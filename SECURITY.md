## Coordinated Disclosure

> :warning: We urge security researchers not to publish vulnerabilities in issue trackers or
discuss them publicly (e.g. on Slack or Twitter).

The [TYPO3 Security Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/security) coordinates
the process with the TYPO3 core developers, extension maintainers and other
affected parties. Once a security fix is available, we prepare a new release and
publish the fixed version. At the same time, we communicate the vulnerability and
the fix to the public by using various communication channels such as:

* [TYPO3 Security Advisories](https://typo3.org/help/security-advisories)
* [TYPO3 Security Team on Twitter](https://twitter.com/typo3_security)
* [#announce channel on Slack](https://typo3.org/community/meet/how-to-use-slack-in-the-typo3-community)
* [TYPO3 Announce Mailing List](https://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce)
